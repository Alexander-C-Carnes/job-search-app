# dmgbuild settings for the Job Search DMG: a fixed window with the app on the left, Applications on the
# right and mac/make_dmg_background.swift's picture behind them. mac/build.sh passes the paths with -D.

# No hide_extensions: it sets Finder info on the app, which breaks its signature (Finder hides ".app" anyway).
