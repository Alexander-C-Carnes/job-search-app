## Commands

```bash
python -m jobpipe show-request                 # the exact API body for each saved search (free)
python -m jobpipe preflight                    # how many jobs match each search (≤ 1 credit each)
python -m jobpipe run                          # everything: search → signal score → make résumés for top 3 → Notion → digest
python -m jobpipe run --search tpm-remote --top 1
python -m jobpipe run --no-tailor              # signal score only (cheap), then make résumés by hand:

python -m jobpipe jobs                         # stored jobs with signal scores
python -m jobpipe startups refresh             # funding news + YC directory + VC boards -> data/startups.json, then their
                                               # careers boards: roles matching your filters land in Find jobs (free)
python -m jobpipe startups scan --limit 100    # just the careers boards
python -m jobpipe startups score --limit 30    # signal-score startup roles in Find jobs (one Claude call each)

python -m jobpipe startups list --stage "Series B" --days 30
python -m jobpipe startups roles <startup id> --add   # its open roles; --add stores the ones matching your filters
python -m jobpipe startups enrich <startup id>  # look up its latest round (FUNDABLE_API_KEY, THEIRSTACK_API_KEY or PDL_API_KEY)
python -m jobpipe credits                      # JobsPipe credit ledger

```

Outputs go to `outputs/<date>/`: the résumé PDFs, `report-*.md`, `heatmap-*.html`, `apply-*.md` and `digest.md`. Each job's working files (`jd.md`, `01-objectives.md` … `resume-final.md`, scorecards, checks) are in `outputs/<date>/runs/<job>/`. Both are in your profile folder, out of git.

## Filters (saved searches)

The app calls these filters; the file and the command line call them searches.

Edit your `searches.yaml`. The example profile's four saved searches:

| id | Titles | Where | Pay |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tpm-remote` | Technical Program Manager, Principal Program Manager, Program Manager, Technical | remote | $200k+ |
| `em-remote` | Engineering Manager, Manager, Engineering, Manager, Software Engineering | remote | $200k+ |
| `tpm-hybrid` | same TPM titles | hybrid, Portland | $200k+ |
| `em-hybrid` | same EM titles | hybrid, Portland | $200k+ |

Add a search by copying a block. Anything the file doesn't model can go under `api_filters:` and is sent to the API as-is. Ad-hoc queries (`--title`, `--remote`, `--hybrid`, `--location`, `--min-salary`, `--days`, `--limit`) aren't saved.

**Check these once with `preflight`:** `work_arrangement_or`, `job_location_or` and `min_salary_usd` come from JobsPipe's own integration code, not its Python SDK. A request the API rejects costs 1 credit and is never retried; the error shows in `preflight` and `credits`.

## Startup sources

What the Startups tab reads, and what was looked at and left out (checked October 2026). Everything used is free and needs no key, except the round lookups.

| Source | Gives | How |
|---|---|---|
| Google News RSS searches (`"raises" "Series A"`, …) | Round headlines from every outlet it indexes, including the wires that block scripts (FinSMEs, Business Wire, PR Newswire, Pulse 2.0) | `news.google.com/rss/search?q=…`, 100 newest items a query; the publisher after " - " in the title is kept as the source |
| FinSMEs, TechCrunch (venture), Crunchbase News, AlleyWatch (New York) feeds | FinSMEs has the most regular "Acme Raises $8M in Series A Funding" headlines; AlleyWatch is a daily New York funding report | RSS. FinSMEs answers a feed reader's User-Agent only, which the app sends when a feed refuses it |
| YC directory via [yc-oss/api](https://github.com/yc-oss/api) | Every YC company: batch, hiring flag, team size, industries, regions, website. No round (YC's own label is Early/Growth) | Daily JSON mirror of YC's public index; keyless, unlike YC's own search index, whose key rotates |
| VC portfolio boards on Getro (General Catalyst, Techstars, Accel, Insight Partners, Khosla Ventures) | Roles across each portfolio with the company's stage (pre-seed … series H, IPO, acquired, undisclosed) | `api.getro.com/api/v2/collections/<network>/search/jobs`, 20 a page; the network id is read from the board's page. Add any `jobs.<firm>.com` board that runs on Getro under `startups.vc_boards` |
| Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby public job-board APIs | A startup's open roles, with location, remote flag and the posting text | Found from a link on the company's website or careers page, else by trying the company's name as the board name. Each refresh reads up to 300 boards (newest raise first; a board is re-read after a day, a site with no board after two weeks) and the roles answering your filters go to Find jobs |
| Fundable, TheirStack, People Data Labs (optional, keys) | The latest round of a company the news didn't cover | One lookup a click, or up to `startups.enrich.per_refresh` a refresh |

Looked at and not used: **Crunchbase** (no API for individuals since the Basic API ended; enterprise only), **Harmonic**, **Dealroom's full API**, **PitchBook**, **CB Insights**, **Tracxn**, **Specter** (all sales-gated, thousands a year); **Wellfound**, **Built In** and **Work at a Startup** job pages (no API, and their terms forbid scraping); **Consider**-run VC boards such as jobs.lsvp.com (free but need a session token, and only say Seed / Series A / Growth); **SEC EDGAR Form D** (free and authoritative for US raises, with the amount sold and date, but it never names the round and half the filings are funds; a good later addition); **Hacker News "Who is hiring?"** (free, stage only when the comment says it); **Dealroom's free feed** (a few stale items); **VentureBeat** (blocks scripts), **Axios Pro Rata**, **Term Sheet** and **StrictlyVC** (no deal data in their feeds or dead); **Wikidata** (no funding data). The round in a headline is read by a pattern, so a company named oddly in a headline ("Neocloud PaleBlueDot AI") can land under the wrong name; the headline is kept beside every round so you can check.

## JobsPipe credits

One credit buys one job for the rest of the calendar month; re-running a search only charges for jobs you haven't had this month, and an empty result is free. So the cost is the number of distinct jobs your filters let through, not how often you run. The pipeline:

- caps each search at its `limit` and each run at `budget.max_credits_per_run` (40), lowering `limit` when the budget runs short;
- tracks every call in `data/credits.json` against `budget.allowance` (the free plan's 1,000 credits are one-time; set `period: monthly` on a paid plan). In the app, click the credits count in the header for the ledger: used and left, use by month, and each call with its filter, result, jobs returned, credits charged and the request it sent;
- filters on JobsPipe's side before you pay; the local filters (remote/hybrid, pay floor, closed postings) only drop jobs already paid for.

## JobsPipe in Claude

- **Claude Code:** `.mcp.json` registers the JobsPipe MCP server (`https://mcp.jobspipe.dev/mcp`) using `JOBSPIPE_API_KEY` from your environment.
- **claude.ai / Claude desktop:** Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → URL `https://mcp.jobspipe.dev/mcp`, then sign in.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

They run offline: JobsPipe, Notion and Claude are mocked (a stand-in `claude` executable for the Claude Code runner; the real SDK with a mock transport for the API runner), while the real `check_resume.py`, `heatmap.py` and PDF renderer run. The evidence models are switched off, and `tests/test_evidence.py` uses word-overlap stand-ins for them. They run for the example profile's made-up candidate (`example-profile/`), in a temporary folder, never your profile.

## Making a Mac app release (for maintainers)

Published releases are on the public repo's [Releases page](https://github.com/Alexander-C-Carnes/job-search-app/releases).

`mac/build.sh` builds `build/Job Search.app` and a DMG on the Mac you run it on: it downloads a standalone Python ([python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone)), installs `requirements.txt` into it (without pytest and sentence-transformers), adds headless Chromium for the PDFs, copies `jobpipe/`, `skill/` and `example-profile/`, and compiles the launcher (`mac/Launcher.swift`), which starts the server and opens the page. The DMG opens on a laid-out window, the app on the left and Applications on the right with an arrow and a line on what to do, drawn by `mac/make_dmg_background.swift` and placed by [dmgbuild](https://github.com/dmgbuild/dmgbuild) from `mac/dmg_settings.py` (no Finder scripting, so it works on GitHub's Macs). With a "Developer ID Application" certificate in your keychain it signs everything; `--notarize` also sends it to Apple, so it opens with no warning (`mac/build.sh --help` lists the options).

Releases go out on their own once a day (07:00 UTC) when the code changed since the last one: the **Mac app** workflow (`.github/workflows/mac-app.yml`) tags the next version (v0.1.0 → v0.1.1), builds the Apple silicon and Intel DMGs on GitHub's Macs, and publishes them as a GitHub Release once both builds pass, which is free for a public repo. Installed apps offer the new version the next time they open. To release sooner, push a tag (`git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`), or use **Actions → Mac app → Run workflow** and tick *release*; without the tick it's a test build. It signs and notarizes the DMGs when the repo has the secrets listed at the top of that file; without them they're unsigned, and people click **Open Anyway** once.
