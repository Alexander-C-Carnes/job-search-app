# Which AI does the work

Pick it on the **Profile** tab, under **AI**: the provider, its key, and a model and effort for each step (signal score, analysis, writing). It's saved in `models:` in your `searches.yaml` and the key in your profile's `.env`. **Check connection** lists the provider's models, which also confirms the key works.

| Provider (`models.backend`) | How you pay | Key in `.env` |
|---|---|---|
| Claude, your subscription (`claude-code`, the default) | Your Pro or Max plan; nothing per call | none: sign in to Claude Code |
| Claude API (`api`) | Per call | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| ChatGPT, OpenAI API (`openai`) | Per call (a ChatGPT subscription doesn't include it) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Gemini, Google AI API (`gemini`) | Per call; check Google for a free allowance | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter (`openrouter`): models from many companies | Per call; a few models are free | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Ollama or LM Studio on your Mac (`ollama`, `lmstudio`) | Free | none |
| Any other OpenAI-compatible API (`openai-compatible`, with `models.base_url`) | Depends | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`, if it needs one |

Things to know before switching from Claude:

- **Quality.** The briefs and rules were tuned on Claude Opus. Every résumé still goes through the same format, honesty-trace and ATS checks, and broken output is asked for again, but a weaker model writes weaker résumés and fit scores.
- **Size.** Every candidate-facing step reads your whole impact record, every résumé and the rules at once, often 30,000 tokens or more. A local model needs a context window that large (Ollama: set `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536` and restart it; LM Studio: load the model with a 64k context). If a server cuts the prompt short, the step stops with an error rather than scoring on half your record.
- **Cost.** Make résumé is about 11 calls with all of that material, so on a pay-per-call provider it costs real money per job. The same materials go first in every request, so providers that cache repeated prompts (OpenAI does, automatically) charge less for them.
- **Effort** is sent as `reasoning_effort`; a model that doesn't take it gets the request again without it.

Signing in with a ChatGPT or Google subscription (instead of an API key) isn't supported yet: OpenAI's Codex CLI can't be fully stopped from using its own tools, and Google has retired the Gemini CLI's personal sign-in.

## Claude through your subscription

Every Claude step runs through the Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`), which uses your Claude subscription (Pro/Max) instead of API credits (`models.backend: claude-code`, the default). The pipeline uses the first `claude` that starts: each one on your PATH, then `~/.local/bin/claude`, then the CLI bundled with the Claude desktop app, so an old install that crashes under a newer Node is skipped. Set `CLAUDE_BIN` or `models.claude_bin` to choose one yourself. The CLI must be signed in: run `claude` and use `/login`. Each agent runs with no tools, no MCP servers and no skills; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is removed from its environment so Claude Code can't bill an API key instead of your login. Calls count toward your plan's usage limits: triage is one short call per job (15 jobs took about 2 minutes), and a full tailoring run is about 11 calls. Each command prints its token totals at the end.

All stages use Claude Opus 5.5 (`models:` in `searches.yaml`; triage at low effort, analysis at medium, writing at high). The impact record, résumé variants, rules and rubric form one system prompt shared by every candidate-facing agent. To use the Claude API instead, set `models.backend: api` and put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your profile's `.env`; that path needs API credits.
