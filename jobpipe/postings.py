"""Is a posting still open? Roles in Find jobs are found once and otherwise never looked at again, so a role that
closed after it was found stays in the list. check_closed() asks the posting's page (or its applicant-tracking
system) and moves closed roles to Dismissed, tagged Closed.

A posting you applied to is kept for good, to read again before an interview after the page comes down.
keep_applied() saves the posting text of every tracked job in an applied stage that doesn't have it yet;
PostingKeeper runs it in the background whenever a status may have changed.
