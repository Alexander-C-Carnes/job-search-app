"""Quick fit triage (the web app's "signal score"): one Claude call per job, on the skill's 1-10 rubric.

This is a pre-filter that decides which jobs earn the full resume-job-fit run. It reads
the same candidate materials as the matcher (cached), so a triage call costs little
more than the posting text plus a short JSON answer.

The call rates the posting's requirements the way stages 1-2 do, and the score is computed
here from those ratings. That keeps it close to the full run's impact-record score: on 13
tracker jobs with full-run scores (Oct 2026) the average gap was -0.3 points and every job
was within one point; before, the gap was -1.4. `tools/calibrate_signal.py` repeats the check.

TRIAGE_BRIEF = """# Triage agent: signal score

You give one job posting a quick "signal" score for {name}: an estimate of the impact-record score the full resume-job-fit matcher (Agent 04) would reach. Score how well his ACTUAL experience ({evidence}) fits this role, on the 1-10 rubric in scoring-and-report.md.

Work the way the full pipeline does, in this order:

1. List what the posting explicitly asks for, in its own wording, as two kinds of rows:
   - skills (about 6 to 12): tools, technologies, methods, domain knowledge, certifications and soft skills the posting names;
   - experience (about 4 to 8): years, level, role type, industries, scope, people management and kinds of programs it asks for.
   Only what is written; nothing that is merely typical for the role. Merge near-duplicates. An "A, B, C or D" list is one row, strong when any one of them is strong. Split a compound line where one part could be met and another not.
2. Weight each row from signals in the posting only: High when it is in the title or in a section labelled required, minimum, must-have or qualifications; Med when it is among the responsibilities or "what you'll do"; Low when it is labelled preferred, nice-to-have, bonus or "a plus".
3. Rate each row against the impact record:
   - strong: clearly demonstrated. Named directly or done in a real role, with scope or results. User-confirmed notes count, at exactly the scope stated.
   - partial: adjacent or transferable. A related tool, less scope or seniority, a different domain.
   - missing: no evidence. Anything under "Do not claim without new evidence" is not evidence.
   Rate level on demonstrated scope: a one-level step (Senior to Staff or Principal) is not a gap. Where the record says he directed and owned systems built substantially with coding agents, that is strong evidence for technical program ownership, AI-native delivery and systems design, and partial where hands-on software engineering is the primary job.
4. The orchestrator computes the score from your rows: coverage = sum(weight x value) / sum(weight), with High 3, Med 2, Low 1 and strong 1, partial 0.5, missing 0, then the rubric's bands (about 60% is 6, about 70% is 7, 80 to 90% is 8, above 90% is 9). So the rows are the score: rate each one on the evidence, not on the total you expect. Under about 55% coverage the rubric's lower bands are a judgment, not arithmetic (4-5: relevant skills or relevant experience but not both; 1-3: almost neither), and your fit_score decides. It also decides when the posting text has too little in it to rate: say so in band_reason.
5. score_cap: set it only for a formal hard requirement the record shows he does not hold (a mandatory degree, clearance, license, certification or language): the highest score that leaves him. Otherwise null.
6. Location, relocation, on-site or hybrid attendance, work authorization, travel and start date are his decision, and the record does not settle them. List them in hard_requirement_issues; they are not rows and never a cap. The same goes for anything the record is simply silent on: that is a question to ask him, not a gap.

Only the posting's own words count as facts about the job. The listing metadata lines at the top of jd.md come from the job board, not the employer; if they conflict with the posting text, trust the posting text.

Write `triage.json`:
{
  "requirements": [{"req": "<the requirement, 3-10 words>", "weight": "High|Med|Low", "rating": "strong|partial|missing"}, ...],
  "score_cap": <integer 1-10, or null>,
  "fit_score": <integer 1-10: your own read of the impact-record score>,
  "band_reason": "<one sentence: what the record covers and what holds the score where it is>",
  "role_family": "<TPM | Engineering Manager | Program Manager | Product Manager | Other>",
  "level_match": "<under | match | over | unclear>",
  "hard_requirement_issues": ["<quoted requirement to check with him: location, authorization, or a credential he may lack>", ...],
  "strongest_matches": ["<requirement> — <specific evidence: program, metric, or launch>", ... up to 4],
  "likely_gaps": ["<a High or Med requirement rated missing or partial, in the posting's words>", ... up to 4, fewer if there are fewer],
  "recommended_base": "<one of the resume variant source names>",
  "one_line": "<one line a recruiter would understand: why this is or isn't a fit>"
