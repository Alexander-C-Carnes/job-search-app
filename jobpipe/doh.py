"""Find JobsPipe's address with DNS over HTTPS instead of the network's own DNS.

Some networks filter DNS: an ISP's "safe browsing" filter can answer api.jobspipe.dev with a
block page whose certificate fails, so every search failed with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED. Only the
lookup changes: the connection still goes to api.jobspipe.dev's name for TLS, so its certificate is
checked as before, and every other host the app reaches keeps the network's DNS.
