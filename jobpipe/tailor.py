"""The full resume-job-fit pipeline (Stages 0-6) for one job, ported from the skill.

Stage 0  jd.md (orchestrator)
Stage 1  01 Objectives | 02 Skills | 03 Experience     (parallel, posting only)
Stage 2  04 Matcher -> 04-match.md, ratings.json, keywords.json (+ baseline scorecard)
Stage 3  05 Writers A | B | C                         (parallel) -> drafts, traces, checks
         Rater: rates each draft literally           -> draft scorecard
Stage 4  Merge -> resume-final.md (+ check, honesty check against the evidence, keyword-restore pass if Total
         drops or the evidence supports a missing keyword)
Stage 5  PDF (resume-format) -> page count (trim pass if over the format's page limit), PDF-text scorecard
Stage 6  Heat map + report.md
Stage 7 (Notion) runs in pipeline.py so that triaged jobs share it.

Stages 1-2 are also the "full score" the web app can run on its own (Tailor.analyze). A later
tailoring run reuses that analysis when the posting and the candidate materials haven't changed.

   weights are in 04-match.md and trace-final.md).
2. Then shorten long bullets to at most two lines (about 35 words): keep the posting's lead phrase, the action and
   the strongest figure; drop secondary detail, lists of names, and parentheticals.
3. {limits}
4. Never add or reword a claim, figure, tool or phrase: every word left must already be in the resume. Keep the
   markdown shape, headings, title line, summary's target role and CORE SKILLS.
5. Prefer cutting text whose keywords (keywords.json) also appear elsewhere in the resume.

Add a short note per cell. Score each new resume 1-10 with the rubric in scoring-and-report.md.

Write `{out}`: the complete ratings.json with the new source names appended to "sources", their scores appended to "scores", and one rating (and note) appended to every row's "ratings" (and "notes") array, in the same order. Keep every existing value unchanged.

A local check (honesty.md) compared each line of the tailored resume with the candidate's evidence: every figure must

the impact record, resume variants and confirmed facts state what the line claims. The flagged lines may claim more
than the evidence shows. The model is strict about wording, so some flags are paraphrases of real evidence.

For each flagged line, check it against the impact record, the resume variants and user-confirmed notes:
1. If the evidence supports it as written, keep it unchanged and say where (section or ledger ID) in merge-notes.md.
2. Otherwise rescope it to exactly what the evidence states: its verbs ("contributed to" stays "contributed to"),
   its figures, its scope. A figure the evidence does not state comes out.
3. If nothing true is left, cut the line.

Never add a claim, figure or tool. Change nothing but the flagged lines. Write `resume-final.md`, `trace-final.md`
(updated for the lines you changed) and `merge-notes.md` (the previous notes plus a "Honesty review" section).

- Fit scores, heat map rows, strongest fit, unconfirmed gaps, scorecard stories: from 04-match.md and ratings-final.json. Include the tailored resume as a row.
- ATS scorecard: copy the numbers from scorecard-final.md (the tailored resume row uses the PDF text). Then the missing-keyword split (truthful adds vs. don't add). When keyword-evidence.md is provided, base the split on its verdicts: supported = a truthful add (name the evidence), weak = a question for the candidate, none = don't add.
- Honesty check: if honesty.md is provided and still flags lines, list them under "Lines to check" with the reason.
- Posting-language keywords "Use" and "Held back": from merge-notes.md and 04-match.md.
