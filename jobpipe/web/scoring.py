"""Background scoring for the web app: a batch of jobs is queued, scored a few at a time,
and the page polls /api/summary for progress, so a reload never loses a batch.

Two kinds of score:
  signal  one Claude call (the triage rubric): a quick read on fit. Three at a time.
  full    stages 1-2 of the tailoring pipeline: every requirement rated against the impact
          record and each résumé. About four calls a job, so one job at a time.
