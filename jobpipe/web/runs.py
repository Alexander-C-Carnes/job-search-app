"""Run pipeline commands (`python -m jobpipe ...`) in the background and keep their output.

Up to MAX_RUNS at once, so several jobs can be tailored side by side. A run started with queue=True
when that many are going (Make résumé) waits its turn instead of being refused, and starts by itself
when one finishes. Runs that would collide share a `key` and wait for each other: searches (they spend
JobsPipe credits and write the day's digest) go one at a time, and a job is never tailored by two runs
at once. Each run is told its id (JOBPIPE_RUN_ID), and the store marks the jobs it changes with it, so
a run's results are its own.

Given a database (the app uses data/tracker.db), runs outlive the app. Each one is started through
supervise.py in a session of its own, which saves every line the run prints and its exit status in the
database; the app follows the run there. When the app restarts, it picks up the runs still going and
the ones still waiting their turn (saved too), so restarting the app cuts nothing short. Quitting the
app is different: it stops them (stop_all). A run whose process died without saving its status (the
Mac was shut down) shows as interrupted. Without a database (tests), runs are the app's own child
processes and end with it.
